                <p>I started out in <a class="bg-sky-600/40 px-1 py-0.5 text-sm font-medium hover:underline rounded-sm" href="https://joshuaknauber.artstation.com/" target="_blank">3D art</a>, my goal was to create visuals for movies. This was my jumping off point into programming.<br/>I built tools for Blender, first for myself, then for other artists.<br/>This led me to discover engineering and design. I built more tools for artists, <a class="bg-sky-600/40 px-1 py-0.5 text-sm font-medium hover:underline rounded-sm" href="https://superhivemarket.com/products/serpens" target="_blank">sold them</a> and started growning <a class="bg-sky-600/40 px-1 py-0.5 text-sm font-medium hover:underline rounded-sm" href="https://discord.com/invite/NK6kyae" target="_blank">my own communities</a> around them. Serpens currently has a few thousand paying users and a great community around it.</p>

                <p>The most rewarding part was seeing people build their own lives around my tool. Enabling them to do what they are passionate about is what drove me to go deeper into this world.<br/>I studied Interaction Design and <a class="bg-sky-600/40 px-1 py-0.5 text-sm font-medium hover:underline rounded-sm" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-knauber-410b31221/" target="_blank">joined Tesla</a> in 2022, where I've been lucky to work with exceptional people in engineering and design.</p>

            <p class="max-w-prose text-center text-2xl font-medium">Paper is exciting to me because it has the potential to do what I believe a good tool should be:<br/>Tools are a necessary evil, our goals as their builders is to remove the friction of bringing an idea to life. With Paper, the tool can become invisible and even inspire creativity.</p>
